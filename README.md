## Project title

This is a toolbox to be used by Medical Social Workers (MSWs) to make referrals to community services while they are at their patients' homes. The functions include

## Motivation

Part of a MSW's role is to link their patients up with community services as part of their care. This applies to both patients in the hospitals and clinics, and those who are at home. Currently, when a MSW identifies that a patient needs to be linked up with a community service, she may not know the services that are in the particular patient's committee. Even if she knows, she will need to do so when she is back in the office, despite having the necessary tools with her.

This application hopes to be able to perform both of these functions, and ideally, as part of a wider eco-system of applications.
